This project sets up an end-to-end **ETL pipeline** to extract, transform, and load Zillow data from an S3 bucket into **Amazon Redshift** for further analysis and visualization using **AWS QuickSight**. 

The project is divided into three main sections, each containing detailed instructions for setup and execution.
